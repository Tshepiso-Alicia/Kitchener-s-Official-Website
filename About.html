        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>Established in 1906, Kitchener's is housed in a old building that dates back over a century, evolving a simple barely-noticeable pub into a vibrant landmark. Over the years, Kitchener's has transformed into more than a basic bar but now for it's diverse music events, creativity, connectivity, and more. Our place has cultivated a safe space for emerging artists such as musicians, dancers and comedians, as well as everyone else who enters the building seeking our delicious products or rich social activity, our energy is unmatched! Our sibling space, Little Kitchener's, was created from the same essence and love for great food and conversations that cultivate joy, growth and authenticity .</p>
        <p>Our current founder, Adam Levy, is a firm believer of the significance of connectivity, what seems like a business of food, drinks and music is actually more than that. He wanted to portray a relaxed and intimate environment for different people while nurturing the creativity and vibrance every indidual possesses within themselves. Kitchener's brings together individuals from different backgrounds or upbringings that have the desire to be a part of the culture and the unique creative movement, there is so much room created for diversity and story-telling, whether we attract an audience looking for an amazing DJ mix that sets the soul on fire, a conversation that ignites new ideas and train of thought, or just a fun time with good friends, old or new, and great drinks. You are not just a part of our story, you are the reason we have a story!</p>
